# Contribution guidelines

All contribution ideas are welcome in consideration for fixes and features on the existng codebase! 
However, please note that a tired developer will be looking over them and would much rather the requests made things easy for him:
* such as describing accurately what the request changes 
* existing in an isolated branch that doesnt cause new merge conflicts.

Everything else will be considered on a case by case basis for now. Experiment, have fun and thanks in advance for your contribution!

NOTE: All merged contributors will have their names/Github handles added to the relevant credits screens once those are ready to be created 
(contributors will be contacted individually about which they prefer)
