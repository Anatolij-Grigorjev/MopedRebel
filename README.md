# MopedRebel
A 2D game about a moped delivery driver, using acts of minor rebellion to increase their own street cred and quit their deadbeat job

## Lede
A rebel in the land of conformist moped users, moped rebel (MR) is a too-cool-for-school punk that doesn't abide by the rules and is always out looking for ways to undermine the “Man”, man…
Sadly, MR has to balance this hobby with their very mundane delivery service job, working moped deliveries for CargoRiders™ . Armed with nothing but a moped and a bad attitude, MR are out for blood on the bloodless streets of Nothingtown, TheCountry.
Their goal? To somehow make enough of a living with enough street cred in this dingy town to leave the deadbeat job of delivery moped for a lucrative career of their own choice.
